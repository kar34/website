					<h1 class="phototitle">Overview</h1>
					<p class="light">Ubi Interactive is a Seattle-based startup that turns any projected display into a touch screen. As Ubi began to grow, it became obvious that an overhaul of the single-page website was necessary. The new website I designed lead to significantly higher engagement and trial downloads.</p>

				<h1 class="marginauto center">My Team &amp; Role</h1>
				<p class="dark center marginauto">I was the UI/UX designer on this team but also assisted the Product Manager with strategy and Web Developer with building the site. On the design side, I was responsible for establishing personas, creating wireframes, user flows, leading user testing, and creating clickable mockups.</p>

				<h1>User Research</h1>
				<p class="light">Using the personas I created through customer interviews, I made a list of problems that currently existed with the current website based on the persona requirements. Here are the highlights:</p>
				<p class="light">1. People didn’t understand what Ubi was and it’s value proposition. There was a lot of missing product information.</p>
				<p class="light">2. The language was too sophisticated for teachers but not detailed enough for technical people.</p>
				<p class="light">3. Poor visual design gave the impression that Ubi’s technology was not up to par.</p>

				<h1>Wireframes</h1>
				<p class="light">The new homepage design featured a full screen video that showcased Ubi in action with a text overlay to communicate Ubi’s value proposition. It also provided relevant info for each of Ubi’s three main personas.</p>

		<div id="mockups">
			<div class="centersection valign">
				<h1>Mockups</h1>
				<p class="dark">After wireframing, I moved the designs into a medium-fidelity, clickable mock using Adobe Fireworks. The color palette featured Ubi’s core brand colors and Raleway was chosen to match Ubi’s playful, yet simple technocolgy.</p>

			<div class="ubiut valign">
				<h1>User Testing</h1>
				<p class="light">I designed a study that would teach us about the website's navigation, aesthetic, and clarity. After the study, we concluded:</p>
				<p class="light">1. Users understood the value prop of Ubi but not how the hardware components worked with the software, so an explanation graphic was added in the product page.</p>
				<p class="light">2. The pricing table was still confusing to people, so the table was restructured.</p>
				<p class="light">3. The new visual design changed people’s perception of Ubi’s technology in a positive way.</p>

					<p class="light">The impact of this project was overwhelmingly positive:</p>
					<p class="light">Average session duration increased 44%<br>
					Bounce rate decreased 19%<br>
					Number of trial monthly downloads increased 23%</p>
