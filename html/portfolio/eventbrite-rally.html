					<h1 class="phototitle">Overview</h1>
					<p class="light">Eventbrite’s blog called ‘Rally’, immerses people into local culture, music, and live experiences. Rally visitors were engaging with several articles per visit and were mainly repeat visitors. Because people were coming back regularly and other marketplaces successfully integrated editorial content into their native apps, it made sense for Eventbrite to do the same.</p>

				<p class="dark center marginauto">I was the UX Designer on the team for this project. It was an all intern team made of a Product Designer, Product Manager, and iOS engineer. I was responsible for sketching, creating wireframes, user flows, leading user testing, and assisting the Product Designer with visual design.</p>

				<h1>Research</h1>
				<p class="light">During the research phase, we decided that we were designing for ‘Socialite Sally’ – a persona that is the social ring leader among her friends. She’s an influencer and regularly seeks out social adventures for her friend group to experience. We met with the marketing team to understand the current strategy behind Rally and create a game plan that would make the mobile integration a success. We also looked at similar products for design inspiration.</p>

				<h1 class="centersection">User Testing</h1>
				<p class="dark centersection">With limited time to test, we had to be strategic about what to test with users. Mixing online tools with in-person methodology, we tested two main concepts: staggered posts and a post at the top of the feed. The main takeaway was that the staggered designs made the editorial content feel like sponsored ads, causing banner blindness. For that reason, we moved forward with the top banner over the staggered design.</p>
