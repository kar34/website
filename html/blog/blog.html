		<h2 class="post-title">6 Tools Every UX’er Should Become BFFs With</h2>
		<h5>Paper &amp; Pencil</h5>
		<p>Everybody is different, but I’ve found that my most successful projects started in my sketchbook. Jumping straight to wireframes can help you bust out a project faster, but there are a number of reasons why I think starting with sketching helps (for most projects).</p>
		<p>Especially when tackling challenging problems, sketching puts you in the right mindset to get familiar with all the moving parts and flesh out a bunch of concepts quickly. Its also beneficial to show people really low-fidelity designs, because that’s the only time people don’t get stuck up on small details. When you go too high fidelity early, people give you feedback on things you don’t really care about yet, which can be frustrating.</p>
		<h5>Sketch 3</h5>
		<p>Sketch 3 has been gaining some major traction in the design community. A lot of companies have switched over to using it as their main software tool. Sketch is essentially a Photoshop/Illustrator competitor that is lighter, but still incredibly powerful, especially for quick wireframes and rapid prototyping. Sketch also comes with a bunch of templates for Material Design and iOS as well. It’s a one-time $49 purchase instead of dealing with Adobe’s monthly subscription.</p>
		<h5>Invision</h5>
		<p>Invision is awesome. They’ve been busting out new features left and right this summer. Invision allows you to turn the mockups files (Sketch, Illustrator, Photoshop, PNG/JPG etc), you upload into a fully clickable prototype by linking screens together through hotspots. Its also an excellent platform for getting feedback from coworkers and friends. They can leave comments on specific locations on your mockup and you can respond to them as well, much like the Google Docs commenting feature.</p>
		<h5>Usertesting.com &amp; Usability Hub</h5>
		<p>These tools allow you to do user testing remotely and in 10x faster. You can put up tests online, watch people complete tasks, and get actionable feedback within a day. Normally this process will take at least a week if you do it in person. If the company you’re working for has a subscription to these services, they are incredibly powerful. Otherwise, they’re a little pricey to use on your own.</p>
		<h5>Axure</h5>
		<p>I use Axure for mapping user flows, site maps and clickable wireframes. The learning curve is high, but if you run through tutorials, everything makes sense pretty quickly. Axure is incredibly powerful because it allows you to test your design really early in the process. You can have dynamic content, click/hover/scroll behaviors, pass variables between screens when using form fields and a lot more. I’d never use this tool for visual design, but it’s a great way to give a demo of your design and show how everything fits together early on in the process.</p>
		<h5>Google Analytics &amp; Optimizely </h5>
		<p>Data is a UX Designer &amp; Product Manager’s best friend. Whether its Google Analytics, A/B test results from Optimizely, or data from your company’s database, use it! People respond really well when you use data correctly to advocate for your designs.</p>

		<h2>Sketch 3 Shortcuts &amp; Plugins That Will Save Your Life</h2>
		<p>Before looking at any of these plugins, install Sketch Toolbox. It makes installing any Sketch plugin from Github really easy and automatically updates them as the developer releases improvements.</p>
		<h3>Shortcuts</h3>
		<p>If you master these shortcuts and incorporate them into your everyday workflow, you’ll be able to zip through projects like its your job (which would be a good thing, especially if it actually is your job).</p>

		</ul>

		<h3>Plugins</h3>
		<p>No software is perfect. Even with our favorite ones, there are still things that bug us. I think these plugins will help alleviate some of those pains.</p>
		<h5>Content Generator Sketch Plugin</h5>
		<p>Instead of creeping your friends out when they randomly find themselves in your prototype, this plugin generates random data like avatars, names, photos, phone numbers, addresses etc. </p>
		<h5>Sketch Better Paste</h5>
		<p>One of the things that bothers me most about Sketch is when I paste something. Why the hell does it show up 4 artboards over? This plugin will place things in the center of the screen when you paste into your sketch file.</p>
		<h5>Sketch Dynamic Button</h5>
		<p>This plugin allows you to create buttons with fixed margins so you can adjust the size of the rectangle without the text getting messed up. </p>
		<h5>Sketch Page Switch</h5>
		<p>While not a huge pain point of Sketch, being able to switch between pages faster is never something I’d complain about.  </p>
		<h5>Sketch Constraints</h5>
		<p>This plugin essentially makes it possible to have adaptive layouts in Sketch. When you scale your artboards, the content will scale with it. Its a huge life saver, especially if you’re working on multi-platform designs. </p>

		<h2>UX Is Not UI</h2>
		<p>I don’t like that I’m writing about this because if you’re a designer, the classic conversation about UI vs UX has become cliche and old. But I’ve found that even people familiar with design use them interchangeably, which is wrong. I’m not trying to be entitled here—I’m sure some developers cringe when I talk to them about their code. But that’s why designers design, engineers engineer, salespeople sell and researchers research. We don’t do each others work and there’s a reason for that, because we’re good at what we do and not so good at what we don’t do.</p>
		<p>While they are commonly mentioned together, UX and UI should not be used interchangeably. It turns out there’s actually an entire website dedicated to this idea: http://www.uxisnotui.com/. All of this is extremely subjective because different people and companies define this in a different way, but to me UI is essentially the product of interaction and visual design. UX goes beyond the interface and concentrates on the experience a user has when using your product. It addresses not only whats going on on the screen, but what’s going on behind the screen, and the physical environment or context the product is being used in. Ultimately UX is all about the user, their behavior and needs, and whether the product design is actually adding value.</p>
		<p>The difference between UI and UX is well illustrated through Patrick Neeman’s metaphor of cereal. At the end of the day, you use UI to accomplish something bigger. You press a button to order a shirt from Amazon or you press a button for a ride to show up. You use a spoon to eat cereal. The “something bigger” is what UX cares out. UI is simply the means to an end.</p>
		<p><img src="../../img/cereal1.png" style="height:50%; width:50%;"></p>
		<p><img src="../../img/cereal2.png" style="height:50%; width:50%;"></p>
		<p><img src="../../img/cereal3.png" style="height:50%; width:50%;"></p>
		<p>Just like you can’t use cereal and a spoon interchangeably, the same goes for user experience and user interface. They aren’t the same. While cereal may be more sexier than a spoon, the idea here is that UX is so much more than just UI Design. If you are talking about the design of an app (the Uber interface), that’s UI. If you’re talking about the whole experience using the app (whether your driver showed up on time, how friendly your driver was, etc), that’s UX. The reason I love UX is because it tackles such a large scope of issues that can often be incredibly challenging to solve.</p>

							<p>Ok here it goes. My unfiltered thoughts. No backspaces. Sitting here, typing this, I’m still in shock of what happened. 4 days later and it hurts just as bad as it did on Sunday. I normally listen sports talk radio every day. Even when I was studying abroad, I listened to podcasts almost every day. But I’ve ignored that for an entire week. I want to ignore it as much as possible because whenever I don’t, its really depressing.</p>
<p>Things really should have gone down differently. Like it really, really should have ended differently. It sucks. It sucks a lot. There’s no way of sugar coding it. “There’s always next year.” I don’t care about next year. I care about this year and right now. They were going for back to back championships, which would have been special. We should be celebrating right now. That was easily the most devastating moment of Seattle sports history. No question about it. </p>
<p>Many people called that play call the worst play call in Super Bowl history. Ouch. Darrell Bevell has taken a lot of heat, as he should. He absolutely should. The reason we lost the game was because of poor execution but even worse play calling. Wilson should have thrown the ball lower. That’s an easy throw. Lockette should have come in harder to the ball. But most importantly, that play should have never been called. You have the most relentless back in the league on the one yard league. I don’t care how many timeouts you have left. I don’t care how much time is left. I don’t care if the Patriots know exactly what play you are about to call. YOU GIVE IT TO MARSHAWN. </p>
<p>Sports will do that to you though. There’s so much emotion involved. It brings you to absolute highs, then drops you off a cliff. The most incredible comeback in NFL playoff history one week and the next week you lose on the one. Staying up all night the night before, having nervous panic attacks, randomly starting to shake, the pacing, the emotion filled hugs. On Super Bowl Sunday I woke up and ate a box of Oreos, sitting in my bed, watching Seahawk highlights because I couldn’t think about anything else.</p>
<p>After Kearse caught that catch, I knew we were going to win. I didn’t think it. I knew it would happen. 100%. I could feel tears of joy coming on. I haven’t cried tears of joy many times in my life, and the feeling was unreal. I felt so happy. I was already thinking about how epic it would be to have an opportunity to do something no team in NFL history has ever done: win back-to-back-to-back. I was ready to give everybody in the room hugs, tell my friends I love them and remember that moment to tell to my grandkids. </p>
<p>Then my heart stopped. When the pic was thrown, it hurt. It was like a feeling of when you got caught doing something wrong. It was like being startled times 10. When you are shocked and you’re shaking for the next hour. That was the feeling. The moment I realized what happened, I felt the immediate endorphin rush from my head to my toes. It was just absolute shock. It was the same feeling as a couple weeks ago, when we came back against the Packers. Just absolute disbelief. </p>
<p>Sports brings you on an emotional roller-coaster. There is nothing else like it. That’s why I absolutely love sports. Seattle has had it pretty rough when it comes to sports history. It’s not fun being a sports fan in this city a lot of the time. Going through experiences like last Sunday will just make the super bowl even sweeter when we win it next year.</p>

<h2>Matemwe Beach</h2>
<p>After finishing our six weeks of classes, it was time for Spring break! Yes, in the southern hemisphere it is spring right now. I’m not that bummed out about having two spring breaks this year. For our one week break, I went to Zanzibar, which is a large island off the coast of Tanzania. To get there, we took a 12 passenger plane from Iringa to Dar es Salaam. We could feel every bump. Once we were in Dar, our next flight to Zanzibar wasn’t for another couple hours, but since we were all there (we took up the entire plane), they called the pilot and we took off an hour earlier than expected. I can just picture that not happening in the US right now…</p>
<p>For the first five days, we stayed at Matemwe Beach, which was absolutely gorgeous. We stayed in a bungalow, which had wifi, air conditioning, and hot water, which to us were luxuries. The bungalows were about a thirty second walk to the beach. The locals would always tell us “Jambo” and “Hakuna Matata” which was frustrating because after living here for a couple months, we know no one actually says that. “Hakuna Matata” is only said in Kenyan Kiswahili and “Jambo” is also not really used by Tanzanians unless they’re talking to tourists. </p>
<p>The tide on the beach was very strong – during the day the tide went out almost mile (not exaggerating). It was shallow. A friend and I swam out for about thirty minutes and it was still only about ten feet deep. The tide was so strong we had to go to a different part of the island at the end of our scuba dives because the water was too shallow for the boat to make it through.</p>
<h2>Scuba Diving</h2>
<p>Speaking of scuba, I went scuba diving! I did an online course, one pool dive to learn basic skills, and four ocean dives to get my certificate. Then after I became a licensed diver, we went on two more dives the next day which was awesome because we didn’t have to do any skills, we could just explore. During the certification dives, we learned skills like clearing water out of our mask, emergency ascents, equalizing your ears as you go down, buoyancy and lots of other things. We went down 60 feet and it was absolutely beautiful. Very colorful and lots of life! On one dive, I got really close to a snapper fish, which are apparently really territorial and bite hard. Luckily my instructor knew this and grabbed my fin and pulled me back as I was trying to swim closer to it. We did a really bad job of taking pictures of our scuba adventures, considering we do not have any.</p>

<h2>[Cononut] Tree Climbing &amp; Stars</h2>
<p>On the way to dinner one day, I decided to climb a coconut tree. It looked like fun. At first, I really struggled and everyone was making fun of me because I was barely a couple inches off the ground. I used that as motivation though and learned real quick. I inched my way up and once I made it half way, everyone realized they were wrong. <img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"> Some of them told me to come back down because it was dangerous. Instead, later, I went to the top. It was exhausting. I was holding on the the tree so hard because I did not want to fall. If you ever get tired of the bench press, climbing trees is a very good alternative. At the top, it was about 40 feet off the ground. Very terrifying but fun experience for me. </p>
<p>That night, we walked along the beach to go home after dinner. It was pitch black on the beach. I thought the safari landscape was incredible—which it was, but WOW the stars on Matemwe Beach were breathtaking. It was ridiculous how many stars there were… I had never seen that many in my life before. You could see the Milky Way so clearly. Everything about that walk was perfect, the white sand in between my toes as I walked, the sound of waves crashing against the shore, coconut trees, the cool breeze, and stars that lit up the entire sky. Seeing the stars here in Zanzibar make me really excited for when we go to live in Igoda Village.  </p>

<h2>Stone Town</h2>
<p>After Matemwe Beach, we went to Stone Town, still in Zanzibar. The city actually reminded me of Europe in a lot of ways. There were a lot of really narrow side streets and paths that went in between buildings, awesome gelato, and mopeds everywhere. For dinner, I got seafood pasta with white sauce. IT WAS SOOOO GOOD. It was my first time having white pasta sauce since Europe. I really miss Alfredo sauce. If anyone wants to ship any to me, I wouldn’t be opposed… The next night for dinner we went to this street fair and ate a lot of authentic food. I got a fried cheese and tomato pizza/calzone made from scratch from a guy called Mr. Big Banana. He has huge bananas that were like four inches thick and uses them in some of his dessert pizzas (I got one with Snickers and peanut butter in it).  </p>
<p>Now we are going back home by bus (another 12 hour bus ride from Dar to Iringa). On the bright side, we just saw a giraffe. Next week is final examinations! Then we go to a lake for a half week for an excursion and then leave for our homestays and research in Igoda Village!</p>

<h2>March for Elephants and Rhinos</h2>
<p>Every year in Iringa (the place I am currently staying), there is a parade with hundreds of people to raise awareness for elephant and rhino poaching. The march was about thirty minutes long and it was relatively uneventful but cool to see a whole community get behind something.</p>
<p><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/weave2.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/weave1.jpg" alt="weave1" width="960" height="640" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3657 blogimg"></a><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/weave1.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/weave2.jpg" alt="weave2" width="960" height="640" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3658 blogimg"></a><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/weave3.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/weave3.jpg" alt="weave3" width="960" height="640" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3659 blogimg"></a><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/weave4.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/weave4.jpg" alt="weave4" width="960" height="641" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3660 blogimg"></a></p>
<h2>Basket Weaving</h2>
<p>After the march, we went to a rural village about an hour away from Iringa. In the village there was a group of women who make baskets from coconut tree leaves. When we arrived, we were greated by a the group of thirty who were dancing and singing. We learned from them how to make baskets but didn’t finish them because apparently it normally takes days just to finish one. After the baskets get sold, the mamas use the money to support their children, who we also got a chance to play with. They were really cute. At first they were shy, but then would take a picture of them and after I showed it them, they would start dying of laughter, rolling on the ground. After the first couple, they all started posing and making funny faces with each other. They were really sad to see us leave. </p>
<p><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cook1.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cook1.jpg" alt="cook1" width="960" height="720" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3661 blogimg"></a><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cook2.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cook2.jpg" alt="cook2" width="2048" height="1366" style="margin-bottom:60px !important;" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3662 blogimg"></a></p>
<h2>Cooking</h2>
<p>The next day we learned how to cook from women in another village. In Tanzanian culture, men usually do not ever cook, but they made an exception for us. All twenty of us prepared different things. My job was to prepare the meat, so I washed it, cut it, cooked it over a fire, made a tomato marinade sauce for it and then served it. It took everyone about three hours to prepare everything so it was hard work. After everyone finished, we had a huge feast and all of the food was really good. We had beef, corn, peas, ugali, beans, and I can’t remember what else but it was real good.</p>
<h2>Hiking</h2>
<p>On our way back to Iringa, we stopped at a hiking spot. It was a really short fifteen minute hike to the top, but at the top was the biggest rock I’ve ever seen in my life. It was too big to fit in a picture. I swear it was the inspiration behind Pride Rock in the Lion King. </p>

							<h2>The Safari in a Nutshell</h2>
<p>Going on a safari was one of the coolest things I’ve done in awhile. Traveling into the heart of Africa was unparalleled to anything I have ever experienced before. When the sun began to rise, the African landscape took my breath away— the open space, never-ending sky, baobab trees, the full moon and countless stars the illuminate the night, and sounds of wild animals waking up. All of this gave me a new perspective, made me feel really insignificant in an eye-opening way, and was a subtle reminder to how dominant and beautiful nature can be.  </p>
<p><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/road.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/road.jpg" alt="road" width="960" height="641" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3626 blogimg"></a><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/truckk.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/truckk.jpg" alt="truckk" width="960" height="641" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3627 blogimg"></a> </p>
<h2>On the Way</h2>
<p>We told our program director we wanted to do a 2 day safari, so he made it happen. Our safari vehicle picked us up outside of campus. When it arrived, we all started laughing. The vehicle was an old German fire truck that had been converted into a safari truck. Somehow it fit all 20 of us with open seating at the top. It was about a 4 hour drive to Ruaha National Park from Iringa, where we are currently staying. The entire road to the park was dirt so it was very, very bumpy and dusty but it was an adventure. </p>
<p><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hippo.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hippo.jpg" alt="hippo" width="960" height="641" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3628 blogimg"></a><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ken.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ken.jpg" alt="ken" width="960" height="720" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3629 blogimg"></a></p>
<h2>Animals OMG</h2>
<p>After we entered the park, we started seeing some animals, even though we weren’t officially on our safari yet. The first time we spotted elephants everyone got really excited and made lots of noise so they ran away pretty quickly. From that moment on we were silent. About 10 minutes after the elephants, we stopped at a bridge that went over a creek with crocodiles and hippos. With the sunset in the background, that was probably the most beautiful landscape I had ever seen in my life. It was absolutely gorgeous. </p>
<p>Right after that, there were elephants standing in the road, and we snuck up on them very slowly and quietly. As we passed, they were just feet off the road. Apparently it was too dangerous to stop because they were so close, but we drove by very slowly and got a front row seat to the world’s largest land animals. Then we got to the hostel we were staying at. It was about three dollars per night to stay there.</p>

<h2>Safari Day One</h2>
<p>We all woke up around 5:30 AM and left by 6 AM because apparently the animals are most active at sunrise and sunset. We didn’t even need to leave the hostel area to see our first animal. As we turned a corner, a giraffe appeared just a couple feet away from the truck. It was so close, I almost wanted to touch it but that probably would have been dangerous so I didn’t. The sunrise behind the African wilderness backdrop was beautiful. </p>
<p>Later, we got close to some more elephants, baboons, gazelles, giraffes, warthogs, and zebras. Everyone wanted to see lions, but they were rare in the park we went to and often hard to find. However, our driver talked with another driver who had found them, so our driver casually mentioned to us that lions were going to be up ahead. After visiting the lions, we went back to our hostel and ate breakfast and lunch. The rest of the afternoon was slightly less eventful but we got really close to more elephants and giraffes. We also ran into a herd of almost 100 water buffalo. </p>

<h2>Safari Day Two</h2>
<p>The next day, we woke up at the same time. Some of the girls said they heard lions growling and making noises outside their dorm at night. Our adviser told us that four people had been eaten by lions in the past week at that hostel. It was mainly because they went wandering off, but we still had to take precautions like riding our safari truck to dinner, which was about a one minute walk away. This morning when we woke up, there were a couple elephants right outside our hostel, which was super cool. We heard them trumpet or roar… or whatever the sound an elephant makes is called. We had very little luck finding animals our second day, but thats okay because we saw so many our first day. </p>
<h2>Next Week</h2>
<p>African safari, check. Next post will be on the research I will be starting soon. I’m getting very excited. We have one more week of classes left, which I could not be happier to finish. On Saturday, I’ll be going to Zanzibar to get my scuba license and dive with dolphins, sharks, giant sea turtles, stingrays, fish and all sorts of other cool stuff.</p>

							<p>So this post consists of a couple excursions I have been on in the past month. The safari was really cool so it gets its own post. </p>
<h2>Isimila Stone Age Site</h2>
<p><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tall.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tall.jpg" alt="tall" width="641" height="960" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3610 blogimg"></a><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tall2.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tall2.jpg" alt="tall2" width="720" height="960" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3611 blogimg"></a><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/climb1.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/climb1.jpg" alt="climb1" width="960" height="720" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3612 blogimg"></a><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/climb2.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/climb2.jpg" alt="climb2" width="720" height="960" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3613 blogimg"></a></p>
<p>The Isimila Stone Age Site seemed like it came from a movie set. Very, very cool. The site is home to some of the oldest dated rocks and stone tools on Earth. Because of erosion, there are these huge pillars that formed. There were a lot of prime places to climb. And climb I did. A couple buddies and I climbed almost everything we saw and we ended up falling behind the main group by about 40 minutes. Climbing was so much fun. I told my friends… “Don’t worry about how we’re getting down, just make it to the top.” I fell climbing once but it was so worth it. Our advisor wasn’t the most happy once we finally caught up to the group… but it was his fault for allowing us to fall behind. After exploring the Stone Age site, we went to some random person’s house (well he was a friend of our program advisor) which had a huge backyard and beach volleyball court. We played versus Tanzanians and got crushed so we had to split up the teams 50/50 and then it was fair. </p>
<h2>Kilombero</h2>

<p>Another weekend we traveled about 6 hours away to a place called Kilombero. We stayed at a country club which was holding its annual rugby tournament. There were so many wazungu (“white people” in Swahili) there. The most we had seen in one place since arriving in Africa. Of course none  of us have played rugby before, so we learned about 10 minutes before we played our first game. Our first game didn’t go as bad as I thought it would. We only lost 4-0 and got really close to scoring once. The next couple games we played really good teams and got killed. When we played the best team, we scored twice. We were actually winning for part of the game. That was an accomplishment for us. At the end of the day, we lost all of our games but it was still a very fun afternoon. That night our program advisor bought us all shots of tequila to celebrate our valiant efforts. He was surprised we were able to score. </p>

<p>On the way home we bought sugar cane, which was really cheap and interesting… We also stopped to go on a 4 hour hike which was AWESOME. The hike lead to Tanzania’s largest waterfall, Kalambo Falls which is over 770 feet tall. It is also among one of Africa’s tallest uninterrupted waterfalls. When we got to the top there was an AMAZING view of Kilombero and we ate lunch. Surprisingly, we all found a Snickers bar in our lunch…which may not sound that exciting, but trust me if you were here, it would be. It was like 3rd grade all over again when your mom packed you the best surprise. From the top, we could see for miles and miles… and miles. On the way down, we stopped at a little watering hole thing to swim. The water was freezing but felt very pure and clean. It was a nice little water alcove thing… I seriously don’t know what to call it. You can see in the pictures. That basically sums up Kilombero. Next post will be the safari! Wooo!</p>

							<h2>Hello, Iringa</h2>
<p>Today we checked into the University of Iringa, where we will be taking classes until mid October. Justin Beckham, our resident staff director teaches our Research Methodology class and he does a great job because he has done lots of research. It is interesting because we get to choose a topic to do research on. I will be posting about my topic soon. </p>
<h2>Education System in Tanzania</h2>
<p><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/class.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/class.jpg" alt="class" width="960" height="720" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3599 blogimg"></a></p>
<p>Our Swahili class is also engaging; it is taught by our Program Director, Paulo. He is a Tanzanian, but speaks English very fluently and loves to work with American college students. We go to the bars with him and the other day heard his ringtone on his phone – Call Me Maybe. It was hilarious. The rest of the classes so far… to be brutally honest, classes are extremely boring and not relevant to anything I want to do. Maybe that is why I am the only one in our group that is not an African Studies or liberal artsy major. </p>
<p>I am experiencing how broken the Tanzanian education system is first hand. The teachers are not very engaging. Everything we learn is in a list or something we need to memorize and there is very little discussion. Thank god our classes are only two hours long. Most of the classes on campus go 3-4 hours and the professor just talks the entire time. The classes are in English for everyone on campus, which is good for us, but not so much for the Tanzanian students. Talking with Tanzanian students, it seems like having classes in English for them provides a huge language barrier and obstacle toward learning. For almost all people here, English is their third or fourth language. Its good they are learning a global and helpful language, but it seems obvious to me that in order for the education here to improve, the instruction should be in Swahili, or even better – English should be taught to people at an earlier age so they are fluent before they come to college. </p>
<h2>Food</h2>
<p><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/food.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/food.jpg" alt="food" width="720" height="540" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3600 blogimg"></a></p>
<p>The food on campus at University of Iringa isn’t terrible, its just the same every day and is very carb-heavy. A typical meal is normally rice, beans, maybe beef, maybe some sort of curry and cooked bananas. Everything has a very goopy texture to it, thats for sure. I’ve been here for three weeks now and I’ve lost an inch off my waistline. I don’t get as much protein here as I normally do at home. My friends and I have already been talking about the first places we want to go when we get back. I want to eat Olive Garden (breadsticks OMGGGGG), chicken teriyaki, a burger and milkshake from EJ’s Burgers, oh and Taco Bell. </p>
<p>Thankfully there are other places to eat if you go into town. Burgers are kind of a thing here – same with pizza and pasta. There is an italian place called Mama Iringa, Indian restaurant called Sai Villa and a place that sells burgers called Hasty Tasty. The other day we discovered the biggest supermarket in town. And by supermarket, I mean something the size of a seven eleven convenience store. Most shops here sell very specific things and are really, really small – the size of a shack. So small you can’t even walk in, you tell the person behind the counter what you want. Anyway, this market has MILK (thank god). I was worrying about becoming lactose intolerant because normally in the states I drink a TON of milk. Luckily I do not have to go through withdrawal. Surprisingly, milk is very much a common thing here. Anyway, this market also has Oreos and a couple other American comfort foods. <img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"></p>
<h2>Transportation</h2>
<p><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bus1.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bus1.jpg" alt="bus1" width="960" height="720" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3601 blogimg"></a><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bus2.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bus2.jpg" alt="bus2" width="960" height="720" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3602 blogimg"></a></p>
<p>The university is about 15 minutes from town. Tanzania has public transportation buses called dala dalas. Think of a 12 passenger van and cramming as many people as you can into it. Usually there are about 20 people and constant bodyparts in your face. There is no such thing as personal space on a dala dala. You will be squished and you will like it. I’ve actually gotten pretty used to it now. One time the dala dala was so full that they kept the door open and I hung on from the outside. That was fun. The good thing about dala dalas is that they only cost 400 shillings, which is like 25 cents. </p>
<p>There are also boda bodas, which is like a motorcycle taxi. We’re not allowed to ride them because I guess they’re dangerous. I want to go on one before I leave though. Another way of transportation is by taking a bijaj, which is essentially a three wheeled golf cart. One time a bijaj we were taking home broke down so we had to push it up a hill. The couple main roads in town are paved but everything else is dirt and REALLY bumpy. </p>
<h2>Dorm</h2>
<p><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dorm1.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dorm1.jpg" alt="dorm1" width="720" height="960" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3603 blogimg"></a><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dorm2.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dorm2.jpg" alt="dorm2" width="720" height="960" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3604 blogimg"></a></p>
<p>The dorm I’m in is very ordinary. There are only two other guys in our program so I am rooming with them and one Tanzanian guy will join us in a week. The first shower I took was ice cold and I could not stand under the water for more than a half second, but now I am getting used to it and can. Laundry is done by hand so thats fun.</p>
<h2>Health &amp; Cleanliness</h2>
<p>I have not gotten sick yet. I figure its bound to happen at least once on this trip. A couple people in our study abroad group have gotten malaria, but caught it really early so it wasn’t a problem. We all take preventative daily malaria medication and use mosquito nets when sleeping at night. Malaria is a pretty big problem here. A couple others had a parasite from brushing teeth in tap water. We cannot drink anything but bottled water and have to use it even for brushing teeth. </p>
<p>While doing laundry, we hang our clothes outside to dry. Whenever mosquitoes lay eggs, they look for damp areas. So if you don’t iron your clothes and kill all of misquote fetuses, they can hatch inside of your skin. The only way then to get the baby mosquitoes out of your body is to have a doctor cut you open and pick em out of there. I’m gonna stick with the iron, especially on the underwear.</p>
<h2>Tanzanian Friends</h2>
<p><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/f1.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/f1.jpg" alt="f1" width="960" height="720" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3605 blogimg"></a><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/f2.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/f2.jpg" alt="f2" width="960" height="720" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3606 blogimg"></a></p>
<p>I met a couple Tanzanian students who have become really good friends of mine. Their names are Bosco and Sefa. They study information technology and have gone out of their way to make me feel welcome at the school. They help me practice Swahili, take me out to bars and clubs, and teach me about the local culture. Let me tell you, Africans know how to have a good time when it comes to dancing and clubbing. They go all out on the dance floor. Sefa is an entrepreneur and owns a shop that he started three years ago. I get along with both of those guys really well. I also made another friend named Max, who I brought hiking with us to the Iringa overlook point. More people are moving into the university soon so I hope to meet some more people!</p>

							<p>Orientation is over. Everyone said goodbye to Dar and got ready for our journey to Iringa, where we are staying until the end of October. We strapped all of our luggage on top of a private bus. We were all nervous about it but almost surprisingly, nothing fell off… It looked pretty sketchy. Google Maps said it would take 6.5 hours… but Google Maps also assumed that all the roads were paved, no herds of cattle would cross, we were driving a minivan, there would be no one blocking the roads from accidents, and no traffic… none of which was the case. </p>
<h2>Mini Safari</h2>
<p><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/anm1.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/anm1.jpg" alt="anm1" width="900" height="1200" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3593 blogimg"></a><a href="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/anm2.jpg" class="dJAX_internal"><img src="http://kennysad.ventures/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/anm2.jpg" alt="anm2" width="960" height="720" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3594 blogimg"></a></p>
<p>On the way to Iringa, we went through Mikumi National Park. We saw giraffes, gazelles, and baboons – one of which belted out a loud, high-pitched screech and ran off with its family when we got too close. Our bus also got stopped by a herd of bulls that decided to cross the road. At one of our rest stops, we visited a snake park which had crocodiles. One of the snakes was really irritated with people tapping on the glass and struck at me. It scared the living shit out of me. They also feeded one of the snakes a guinea pig. That was really sad. We all wanted to save it. 13 hours later, we arrived in Iringa and checked into a hotel.</p>
